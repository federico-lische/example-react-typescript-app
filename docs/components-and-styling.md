# Components and Styling

## Components Best Practices

#### Colocate things as close as possible to where they are being used

Place components, functions, styles, and state as close as possible to their points of use. This approach enhances code readability and makes it easier to understand while also optimizing application performance by minimizing unnecessary re-renders during state updates.

#### Stay consistent

Maintain a consistent code style across your project. For instance, if you use PascalCase for component names, apply it universally. Code consistency is largely achieved through linters and code formatters, so ensure these tools are properly configured in your project.

#### Limit the number of props a component is accepting as input

When a component has too many props, consider dividing it into smaller components or using composition with children or slots to simplify its structure.

#### Avoid large components with nested rendering functions

Avoid placing multiple rendering functions within a single component, as this can quickly become difficult to manage. Instead, if a section of UI can function as a standalone unit, extract it into its own component.

```javascript
// this is very difficult to maintain as soon as the component starts growing
function Component() {
  function renderItems() {
    return <ul>...</ul>;
  }
  return <div>{renderItems()}</div>;
}

// extract it in a separate component
function Items() {
  return <ul>...</ul>;
}

function Component() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Items />
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### Abstract shared components into a reusable component library

In larger projects, creating abstractions for shared components enhances consistency and simplifies maintenance. Identify patterns and repetitive elements carefully before building these components to avoid unnecessary abstractions.

Additionally, consider wrapping third-party components to better align them with the application's requirements. This makes it easier to adjust underlying functionality later without disrupting the application."

## Component libraries

Every project requires some UI components such as buttons, forms, menus, etc. Rather than building these from scratch, consider using established, well-proven component libraries to save time and ensure reliability

## Styling Solution

Material UI is a popular styling solution for React applications, providing a comprehensive library of pre-designed, customizable components that follow Googleâ€™s Material Design principles. Using Material UI can significantly speed up development by offering a consistent, polished look and feel across the app without having to design each component from scratch.

Its theming capabilities allow for easy customization to match your brand's style, enabling modifications of colors, typography, and component behavior to suit project requirements. Additionally, Material UI is highly accessible, mobile-friendly, and well-maintained, making it a robust choice for building responsive, user-friendly applications.

With Material UI, you get both a design framework and a rich set of components, which help maintain consistency and scalability as your project grows.
