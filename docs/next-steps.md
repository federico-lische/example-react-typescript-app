## Next Steps

Next steps would involve the following:

Fleshing out the MUI styling theme with more design tokens. 

Establish a consistent use for custom component styling via MUI.
- sx prop
- makeStyles

Build out a design system with design tokens to be imported and used across application.

Build out more ruesable components --> move them to a separate component library package. Integrate Storybook for said reusable components.

Authentication / Authorization
- Sign in and Sign up
- Protected App Routes
- RBAC (Role based access control)

Unit testing: establish 100% code coverage

e2e testing with Playwright

DevOps & CI/CD
- Establish standard for CI/CD
- Use third party tools like GitHub Actions for running checks on pull requests via linters

Performance / Caching
- Establish patterns for performance optimization (React's memo, useMemo and useCallback hooks)
