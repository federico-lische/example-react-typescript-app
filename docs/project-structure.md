```


To ensure scalability and ease of maintenance, organize the majority of your code within a dedicated views folder. Each view folder should house the code specific to that feature, keeping everything well-separated. This structure helps avoid mixing feature-specific code with shared components, making the codebase easier to manage and maintain than a flat folder structure. Adopting this approach improves collaboration, readability, and the overall scalability of the application's architecture.

A view could have the following structure:

```sh
src/views/specific-view
|
+-- components  # components scoped to a specific view
|
+-- hooks       # hooks scoped to a specific view
|
+-- store      # state stores for a specific view
|
```
